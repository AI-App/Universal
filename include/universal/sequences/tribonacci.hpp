 * The series was first described formally by Agronomof in 1914, but its first unintentional 
 * use is in the Origin of species by Charles R. Darwin. In the example of illustrating the 
 * growth of elephant population, he relied on the calculations made by his son, George H. Darwin. 
 * The term tribonacci was suggested by Feinberg in 1963.

/*
 * this begs the question: should the argument and the return value
 * be different types? Clearly, the Tribonacci number will not be
 * representable by the type of the argument as it will be greater
 * than the maximum value associated with the argument type.
 * 
 * To support consistency the answer is yes, as we could write a
 * statement that will yield a consistent answer. Problem is that
 * it would also require a computational relationship between the
 * types that would be rediculously expensive to compute without
 * an analytical formula.
 * 
 * I have settled on a projection from the unsigned ints to a target
 * number system to side step all this complexity.
